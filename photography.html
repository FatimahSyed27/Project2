	  <h1> Photography!</h1>
	  <p> When I'm traveling, visiting new places, or just generally surrounded by vibrant landscapes and breathtaking views, 
		  I like clicking a few pictures to capture the moment.</p> 
	  <p> As you can see below, I've listed the different types of photography that I enjoy!</p>

		  
	  <h3> Landscape Photography </h3>
          <p> This involves daylight photography of natural features of land, sky, water, etc. It may also involve subjects at a distance or nearby.
	  <p> The first picture below is from the time I was kayaking in Michigan, and the second one was from the train station.</p>
          <p> The last two are from the Butterfly Rainforest at the Florida Museum of Natural History.</p>

	  <img src = "./images/nature4.jpg" alt = "Location">
	
	  <h3>Golden-Hour Photography</h3>
	  <p> Golden hour photos are usually took during the last hour before sunset or the first hour after sunrise. 
		  They provide the perfect light to capture stunning photos!</p> 
	  <p> Here are a few "golden-hour" pictures that I took this year</p>

	  <img src = "./images/golden3.jpg" alt = "Location">
	  
	  <h3>Beach Photos</h3>   
	  <p> I'm not a photographer but I do enjoy photography, so here are some beach pictures 8 minutes away from my house:)</p>

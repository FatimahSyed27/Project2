          <p>The Mariana Trench is one of the most deepest points on Earth that has been discovered by scientist. It is located in the western Pacific Ocean 
	     and measures about 2,550 km in length and 69 km in width. </p>
          <p> It's deeper than Mount Everest and nobody has ever touched its floors!</p>

	      <li>A plastic bag? "A recent study revealed that a plastic bag, like the kind given away at grocery stores, is now the deepest known piece of plastic trash, 
		  found at a depth of 10,975 meters (36,000 feet) inside the Mariana Trench" (National Geographic). </li>
